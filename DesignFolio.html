          <ol>
            <li>
              Market Research: Conduct market research to identify the potential

              and preferences of travelers who are likely to be interested in
              visiting Switzerland. This will help determine the target audience
              and guide the design and content decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Competitor Analysis: Study existing websites or platforms that
              promote Switzerland or similar travel destinations. Identify their
              strengths and weaknesses, and use them as inspiration to create a
              unique and compelling user experience for the target audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              User Experience (UX) Design: Consider the user's journey through
              the website and ensure that the design and features are intuitive
              and user-friendly. Conduct user testing to gather feedback and
              make necessary improvements to enhance the overall user
              experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Content Strategy: Plan the content strategy based on the
              identified target audience's interests and needs. Develop engaging
              and informative content that showcases the beauty of Switzerland,
              including captivating visuals, well-written descriptions, and
              practical information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iterative Design Process: Use an iterative design process to
              refine and improve the website continuously. Gather feedback from
              users, track website analytics, and make data-driven decisions to
              optimize the user experience and achieve the website's goals.
            </li>
            <li></li>
          </ol>

          By considering the target audience, incorporating key features, and
          following a well-defined design and development process, the website
          promoting Switzerland can effectively engage users, showcase the
          country's attractions, and inspire visitors to explore the beauty of
          Switzerland.

          When designing the webpages for promoting Switzerland, it is important
          to prioritize accessibility to ensure that all users, including those
          with disabilities, can easily access and navigate the content. Here
          are some considerations and justifications for the use of various
          features in the style guide:
          <ol>
            <li>
              - Text Color: Choose high-contrast color combinations for improved
              readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Background Color: Opt for a light background color to enhance
              readability and reduce eye strain.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Animations: Use subtle animations that enhance the user
              experience without causing discomfort or distraction.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Drop-down Menus: Ensure accessibility for keyboard and screen
              reader users by providing clear indicators and using ARIA
              attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Font Type and Size: Use web-safe fonts with good legibility and
              offer the option to adjust font sizes for users with visual
              impairments.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Links: Use descriptive anchor text, appropriate contrast, and
              visual cues to distinguish links from regular text.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Typography: Maintain consistency in typography, use font styles
              sparingly, and avoid text within images for accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Accessibility Compliance: Adhere to web accessibility standards
              like WCAG 2.1, ensuring keyboard accessibility, alternative text
              for images, proper structure, and labeling of form fields.
